};

POLLIN There is data to read.

POLLPRI
     There is urgent data to read (e.g., out-of-band data on
     TCP socket; pseudoterminal master in packet mode has
     seen state change in slave).

POLLOUT
     Writing is now possible, though a write larger that the
     available space in a socket or pipe will still block
     (unless O_NONBLOCK is set).

POLLRDHUP (since Linux 2.6.17)
     Stream socket peer closed connection, or shut down
     writing half of connection.  The _GNU_SOURCE feature
     test macro must be defined (before including any header
     files) in order to obtain this definition.

POLLERR
     Error condition (only returned in revents; ignored in
     events).

POLLHUP
     Hang up (only returned in revents; ignored in events).
     Note that when reading from a channel such as a pipe or
     a stream socket, this event merely indicates that the
     peer closed its end of the channel.  Subsequent reads
     from the channel will return 0 (end of file) only after
     all outstanding data in the channel has been consumed.

POLLNVAL
     Invalid request: fd not open (only returned in revents;
     ignored in events).
